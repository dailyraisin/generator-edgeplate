## Coding Style

An EditorConfig file is provided to help maintain consistency of basic coding styles by all contributors. If your editor does not support `.editorconfig` files, please review the file and adjust your editor configuration manually.

## Code Annotations

Throughout the source code various code annotations are provided which identify TODO, BUG and NOTE items. These are typically included in code comment blocks for the contributors to review. Code Annotations should not span more than one line.

### TODO Items

TODOs are actionable work items and which identify missing or partially implemented work which requires completion.

__TODO Example__

### BUG Items

BUGs identify know bugs in the code base. A Git Issue may be created and referenced in the BUG declaration if required.

__BUG Example__

    BUG: Form validation broken, see Git Issue #123

### NOTE Items

NOTEs are brief messages within the source code to assist other contributors in understanding specific code or code usage. NOTEs may serve to compliment documentation and DocBlocks but should not replace them.

__NOTE Example__

    NOTE: Modules should only be included in module containers
